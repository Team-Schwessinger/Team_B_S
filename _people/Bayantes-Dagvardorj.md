I am a Senior Research Officer in the Schwessinger lab. My research focuses on the 
intricate interaction of plants and plant pathogens specifically on understanding how these 
interactions result in susceptibility or resistance of plants to the pathogens. This might help
to develop new strategies to improve plant health and thereby world food security. In 
Schwessinger lab, I focus on wheat stripe rust disease. In particular, I study the pathogen 
secreted molecules called avirulence proteins, which are recognized by plant resistance 
gene products and trigger plant immune responses. 

Previous experience:
I received my PhD in Agricultural Biotechnology from Middle East Technical University in 
Turkey (2016). Following this, I took up a postdoctoral research fellow position in the 
laboratory of Prof. Peter Solomon at the Research School of Biology, ANU (2018-2021). 
My previous studies were related to wheat fungal diseases, and much of my previous 
research focused on using model plant systems to understand the function of pathogen 
effector proteins.
