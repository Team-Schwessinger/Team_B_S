I began working with the Schwessinger lab as part of the Sars-Cov2 research team and have now transitioned into cloning and plasmid work for other projects within the lab. <br> 

I graduated with an Advanced Bachelor of Science from ANU in 2021, after completing an Honours year researching scale infestation of grapevine cultivars. I then worked as a research assistant for the Australian Plague Locust Commission. <br>

In my spare time I enjoy bouldering, camping and anything that involves spending time outdoors, with friends.
