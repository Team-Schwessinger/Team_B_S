Tavish is a PhD student with Team Schwessinger, having come through the ANU and worked with the team since 2018. <br>

She works on applying machine learning techniques to long read MinION metabarcoding DNA data to develop a new tool for fungal pathogen identification and detection. She is also working on genome assembly for polykaryotic fungi with 2+ nuclei, phasing genomes and analysing the effect of multiple nuclei on gene expression and evolution.
