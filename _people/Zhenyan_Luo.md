I am a PhD student. After receiving my master's degree, I continue to work on myrtle rust fungus. My projects are mainly related to myrtle rust fungus, currently focusing on investigating mating type genes of rust fungi.

My hobbies are drawing and mushroom identification. I'm also interested in developing R packages for data visualization.
